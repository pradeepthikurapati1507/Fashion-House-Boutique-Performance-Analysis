# Fashion-House-Boutique-Performance-Analysis 2023-2024

Fashion House boutique is a brick and mortar store in Bangalore launched in April 2023. The store specializes in customised womens wear, rental outfits and outfits for sale and has an in-house production team for the same. As the founder, I understand the end-to-end operations and I'm extracting intricate insights to improve the store's performance in terms of revenue, profits, products and marketing.

## Executive Summary

<B>Overview:</B> Leveraging 2,500 sales orders from December 2023 to December 2024 (post-launch period), total revenue was ~£40K (≈₹46.5L) with gross profit ~£13.3K (33% margin). These figures reflect healthy growth for a new store, though further margin optimization is a key opportunity.

<B> Sales Metrics:</B> Average daily sales are ~₹11.9K (≈£102), with the highest single-day revenue ~₹49.3K. Strong sales are concentrated in late-year months (Nov–Dec), aligning with holiday and wedding seasons.

<B> Top Categories:</B> Blouses, dresses, and kurti sets collectively contribute ~56% of revenue, indicating they are core offerings. However, these high-volume items have lower profit margins, highlighting the need for a balanced product mix.

<B> Acquisition Channels:</B> About 46% of customers are store walk-ins and ~46% come via Google Maps, illustrating effective local visibility and Google Business presence. Only ~8% arrive through referrals, suggesting room to grow word-of-mouth marketing.

<B> Customer Behavior:</B> 18% of customers made repeat purchases (8% with >2 orders, 1.5% with >5). High-value orders (>₹5K) represent ~7% of sales. These segments (repeat buyers and big spenders) should be cultivated through targeted outreach.

## Sales Trends and Seasonality
 
#### Monthly revenue exhibits clear seasonality. Sales dip in spring (Mar–Apr ≈ ₹2.52L per month) and climb steadily toward year-end (Nov ≈ ₹5.18L, Dec ≈ ₹8.42L). This trend likely reflects local wedding and festival calendars. The accelerating sales growth in Q4 2024 indicates strong momentum.

#### Insight: The Nov–Dec surge suggests ramping up inventory and marketing before peak season. Introduce promotions in slower months (Mar–Apr) to smooth cash flow and engage customers year-round.

## Product Performance Analysis

#### Revenue is concentrated in a few categories. Blouses, dresses, and kurti sets generate ~56% of total revenue, reflecting strong demand. Profitability, however, is highest for festive and bridal items. The most profitable products are Bridal Lehenga, Embroidered Blouse, and Lehenga Set; in contrast, Blouses and Kurti Sets (high volume) have the lowest margins. Other steady performers include Kids Traditional Wear, Padded Blouses, Gowns, Ready-to-Wear Sarees, and Co-ord Sets.

#### Insight: Emphasize inventory and promotions for high-margin bridal wear. Cross-sell accessories with popular items to lift average order value. Re-examine pricing or procurement for low-margin staples to improve margins without sacrificing volume.

## Customer and Channel Insights

#### The customer base splits evenly between offline and online acquisition. About 46% of transactions are walk-ins, and roughly 46% of customers discover the store via Google Maps, underscoring the importance of location and our Google Business profile. Only ~8% come through referrals, indicating an opportunity to boost word-of-mouth. Payment methods skew digital (~90% UPI, 10% cash). RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary) analysis shows 18% of customers are repeat buyers (8% with >2 orders, 1.5% with >5), revealing a loyal segment to nurture.

#### Insight: Strengthen digital marketing (SEO, Google Ads, social media) since Google drives nearly half of customers. Launch a referral program to boost word-of-mouth. Segment loyalty efforts (email/WhatsApp campaigns) for repeat and high-value customers, leveraging the RFM segments.

# Delivery and Fulfillment

#### Delivery performance is an area for improvement. The average fulfillment time is 6 days; only 18% of orders are delivered in under 4 days, and just 1% within 24 hours. Improving turnaround can enhance customer satisfaction and repeat business.

#### Insight: Map the order-to-delivery process in Power BI to identify bottlenecks (production, packing, shipping). Introduce express shipping options or in-house expedited workflows for urgent orders. Set clear delivery expectations at checkout to improve satisfaction.

# Recommendations

### To improve performance and growth, we recommend:
#### Focus on High-Margin Segments: Prioritize bridal and festive wear in marketing. Feature profitable items (e.g., lehengas, embroidered blouses) on digital channels and in-store displays. Offer bundles (e.g., bridal set + accessories) to increase basket size.
#### Optimize Pricing & Inventory: Reassess pricing for high-volume, low-margin items (blouses, kurtis). Negotiate better fabric costs or adjust price tiers. Use Power BI inventory reports to align stock with predicted seasonal demand, reducing excess and shortages.
#### Enhance Digital Presence: Launch an e-commerce/rental website or online store. Invest in targeted Google Ads and social media campaigns (Instagram, Facebook) to capture wider demand. Keep the Google Business Profile updated with new inventory and promotions to leverage its high visibility.
#### Strengthen Loyalty & Referrals: Implement a loyalty program (points, discounts, tier rewards) to increase repeat purchases. Introduce a referral incentive (discounts for both referrers and referees) to grow word-of-mouth. Send personalized offers via email/WhatsApp to recent and high-value customers using RFM segments.
#### Leverage Advanced Analytics: Build interactive Power BI dashboards for real-time monitoring with slicers (by time, channel, product) and drill-through details. Apply RFM segmentation to flag churn risks and VIP customers. Set up alerting for anomalies (e.g., sudden sales drop) to act quickly on insights.
#### Improve Operational Efficiency: Map fulfillment workflows to pinpoint delays. Cross-train staff to handle peak periods. Negotiate faster shipping or local sourcing of materials to cut raw-material lead times.
#### Experiment & Expand: Pilot new categories (e.g., ready-to-wear sarees, festive collections) and measure results. A/B test promotions (bundles vs. discounts) to optimize conversion. Gather customer feedback and monitor fashion trends to refine the product line.
